# Networked Turned Based Yahtzee Game
This project is first implemented using TDD approach associating Junit tests. Then, Cucumber is used for the final user defined, and senario based tests.

#  Objective:
This project is an individual assignment done for COMP 5104 at Carleton University in the fall semester of 2019.


The purpose of the project was to implement a networked (client/server) version of the Yahtzee game, with a text-based interface that allows each player to see the score sheet of ALL players. This project is programmed to play a single game (i.e. 13 rounds) for exactly 3 players. A first player will initiate the game, then others will join.

Code is tested using a TDD approach associating Junit-like tests SOLELY with the methods that pertain to game logic (viz., playing via the interface AND scoring).

Yahtzee is a simple game whose rules can be found at http://www.yahtzee.org.uk/rules.html

TDD requires that you write (and commit) one or more tests and then the code to make these tests pass (in a separate commit). 
Finally, senario based tests have been done using Cucumber.



Most importantly, you are to use Eclipse, Java, Maven, and Cucumber have been used to implement this project.
